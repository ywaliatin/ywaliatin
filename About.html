  <h2 class="about">About BubsPlaydate </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="border">This website was created for people with bubs who are seeking someone to have a playdate with. Sometimes it is hard to find other bubs with similar routines, especially sleeping and awake times and for parent or carer staying home all day with bub can be lonely too. The purpose of this website is to help people who look for friends with bub’s playdate, as well to share each other’s experiences. People can search for friends, other mums, dads, grandparents, or carers with bub based on the suburb where they live, similar bub’s age and suitable available times and days. That way, the playdate can happen without change to bub’s routine, so bub is happy and content resulting in less stress for parents and carers. People make a friend; bubs can play together. Happy parenting, happy bub!
